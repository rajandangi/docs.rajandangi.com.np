## 🎯 Core Goal

This project documents various programming languages and technologies I've learned. The documentation uses **Material for MkDocs** and is written in **Markdown**.

## ✍️ Content Generation & Rewriting

* **Clarity & Conciseness:** Ensure all explanations are clear, easy to understand, and concise. Avoid overly complex or lengthy sentences.
* **Examples:** Use relevant code examples where appropriate to illustrate concepts.
* **Rewriting:** If asked to rewrite existing content, focus on improving clarity and conciseness while preserving the original meaning.
* **Structure:** Maintain a logical flow within topics (units). Assist with creating internal links between related topics if needed.

## Formatting Rules

* **Output Format:** **Strictly Markdown.**
* **Headings:** Add relevant emojis to main headings (`#`, `##`, etc.) only. Choose emojis that fit the topic of the heading.
* **Images:** If provided with an image file or description, convert it into Markdown image syntax.

## ✨ Style

* Maintain a helpful and informative tone.
* The documentation should be easy to navigate and read.


**Summary for Copilot:** Your primary role is to help create/edit clear, concise Markdown documentation for programming topics using Material for MkDocs conventions. Pay close attention to formatting rules regarding Markdown output, emojis in headings, and image syntax.
